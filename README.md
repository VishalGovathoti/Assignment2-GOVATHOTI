## Egyptian Museum

Based on the artifacts inside, it should rank higher. Based on the building and display of objects, it should rank lower.

The museum is in **Tahrir Square**, which was the location of the recent protests in Egypt. There has been talk of a new museum located closer to the pyramids which would be able to showcase more of the collection  and would also be more secure. 

**When I return to Egypt, I hope to visit a new Egyptian Museum and I hope it will rank higher on this list.**
